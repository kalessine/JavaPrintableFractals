      <P>Several years ago, the Great Mandelbrot Fever began after the 
      <I>Scientific American</I> revealed several of the beautiful Mandelbrot 
      pictures obtained by H.O.&nbsp;Peitgen and P.H.&nbsp;Richter, later 
      published in <I>"The Beauty of Fractals"</I> (Springer-Verlag, 1986). 
      Could the same story have happened again? Very appealing pictures appeared 
      in the September 1991 issue of the <I>Scientific American</I>, again with 
      a (seemingly) simple numerical recipe to get them. Such a picture is 
      featured just above, and a few more at <A 
      href="http://perso.orange.fr/charles.vassallo/en/lyap_art/lyapdoc.html#la_fin">the&nbsp;end</A> 
      of this paper. How about hunting for such pictures by yourselves? 
      <P>Unfortunately, there is a serious problem: by 1992, with a 25 Mhz 
      68030, interesting images took ages to be computed, up to ten hours or 
      even more. The 1997 Pentium and PowerPC are far faster but one now asks 
      for increased resolutions and interesting images, not already explored, 
      are more difficult to compute, so these fractals still require hours of 
      CPU. 
      <P>In a nutshell, the pictures are nothing but a mapping of <A 
      href="http://perso.orange.fr/charles.vassallo/en/lyap_art/lyapdoc.html#exposant">Lyapunov 
      exponents</A> relative to a <A 
      href="http://perso.orange.fr/charles.vassallo/en/lyap_art/lyapdoc.html#markus">simple 
      extension</A> of the <A 
      href="http://perso.orange.fr/charles.vassallo/en/lyap_art/lyapdoc.html#f_log_1">logistic 
      formula</A> (this extension is due to Mario Markus, hence the name 
      Markus-Lyapunov). Want more information? Just read on! And don't let the 
      following few notions of contemporary mathematics deter you!

      <P>The logistic formula (also known as "Verhultz dynamics") is the 
      simplest-known formula describing a chaotic dynamic system. Maybe you 
      don't even know what a dynamic system is? Generally speaking, it's a 
      highly abstract concept: think of a "system" which is examined at 
      successive times; at time (n), the system is described with a variable 
      X(n) (possibly multidimensional) and one admits that a specific law exists 
      that allows to derive X(n) from the preceding X(n-1) (and the latter 
      only). The object of the theory is to discuss the behavior of the 
      successive X's when n grows to infinity. Do they converge towards a 
      unique, stable value? If not, do they behave "regularly"? Or do they have 
      a seemingly erratic, unintelligible, "chaotic" behavior? 
      <P>The <A name=f_log_2>logistic formula</A> simply is a rudimentary 
      attempt to modelize the evolution of an animal population. Here the 
      variable X(n) is the number of animals in an isolated region, at year (n). 
      If the growth rate was constant, the population at year (n+1) would be 
      proportional to the population at year (n), namely 
      <P align=center>X(n+1) = R * X(n) . 
      <P>where R would be constant. Unfortunately, such an assumption would lead 
      to an unrealistic exponential behavior. In fact, the growth rate must 
      decrease when the population increases, because there is less and less 
      food available. The simplest way to express this idea consists in assuming 
      that R at year (n) can be put in the form R0-a*X(n) or, equivalently, 
      <P align=center>R = r * [1-X(n)/Xmax] 
      <P>where r and Xmax are two constants, unspecified so far; Xmax clearly is 
      an upper bound for the population, beyond which the calculation becomes 
      meaningless (the next X would be negative, or zero); r is called 
      "fecundity factor" (the larger it is, the larger the increase from one 
      year to the next one). Putting x(n)=X(n)/Xmax, the evolution law finally 
      becomes 
      <P align=center>x(n+1) = r * x(n) * [1-x(n)] 
      <P>This is the logistic formula. Interesting x values lie between 0 and 1. 

      <P><IMG height=179 alt="[ image ]" 
      src="Introduction to Markus-Lyapunov fractals_files/logist1.gif" width=280 
      align=right> The analysis of this "dynamic system" -i.e. the observation 
      of x(n) when n goes to infinity- for various values of r, can be done with 
      the figure on the right. For every point on the r axis, the logistic 
      formula was applied 200 times, starting from x(0)=0.5 (in fact, this value 
      does not matter), and then 300 times again, but now with plotting the 
      corresponding (r,x) pixel in the figure each time. One notices that there 
      is a single pixel for every r lower than 3: this means that the population 
      then converges to a stable value. <BR clear=all>
      <P>Every r between 3 and 3.45 corresponds to 2 pixels: this means that the 
      population oscillates between a low value (with plenty of food available 
      and a rapid growth), and a high value (no food enough, hence increased 
      mortality): the "fecundity" is too high for a unique stable equilibrium to 
      be possible. Things become more complex when the fecundity is further 
      increased. First, the population oscillates between 4 values, then between 
      8, 16... values, and for r&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;3.57 it seems that there is an 
      infinite number of possible points (forming continuous areas in the 
      figure), between which the population seems to oscillate randomly: this is 
      the <I>chaotic behavior</I>. 
      <P><IMG height=180 alt="[ image ]" 
      src="Introduction to Markus-Lyapunov fractals_files/logist2.gif" width=286 
      align=left> However, the transition to chaos is not definitive: you can 
      see islands with no dark pixels, corresponding to a quieter evolution of 
      the population, which again alternates between a small number of values. 
      You can see the details of such a stability island on the left; the whole 
      figure is an enlargement of the marked area in the preceding image. Notice 
      that the two figures are strikingly similar: this "self-similarity" is a 
      common feature with fractal pictures. <BR clear=all><!-- ********* Les exposants de Lyapounov ********* --><!-- *** titre *** -->

      <P>Lyapunov was a Russian mathematician who lived around the turn of the 
      century, long before computers were invented. We now explain his part in 
      our story. 
      <P>We have seen that, for low fecundity (r&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;3), the 
      population modelized with the <A 
      href="http://perso.orange.fr/charles.vassallo/en/lyap_art/lyapdoc.html#f_log_2">logistic 
      formula</A> converges towards a single value. This limit does not depend 
      on the initial value. If the population is suddenly modified at a given 
      time, it will return to this limit after a few turns. A similar behavior 
      can be observed for multi-valued oscillations: the 2, 4, 8... values 
      forming the limiting cycle do not depend on the initial population, and 
      this cycle is always recovered after a sudden perturbation. However, this 
      return to the periodic cycle is all the longer as one is nearer to the 
      chaos threshold. The limiting cycle is then said to be less and less 
      "stable". This stability can be characterized with a number, <I>the 
      Lyapunov exponent</I>. Stable evolutions correspond to large negative 
      exponents; the stability decreases as the exponent goes closer to 0; 
      finally, positive exponents correspond to chaotic evolutions. 
      <P><A name=recette>The theory</A> of Lyapunov exponents is not easy. The 
      <I>Scientific American</I> paper gives only a practical recipe for 
      computing them in the case of the <A 
      href="http://perso.orange.fr/charles.vassallo/en/lyap_art/lyapdoc.html#f_log_2">logistic 
      formula</A>. Take it as a magic formula:

                      For i=1 to INIT:  x = rx(1-x)

  (2) Derivation      total = 0

      exponent                          total = total + Log|r-2rx|/Log 2
                      exponent = total / NLYAP 
</PRE>
      <P><CODE>x0</CODE> is arbitrary (between 0 and 1); <CODE>INIT</CODE> and 
      <CODE>NLYAP</CODE> are arbitrary integers, which must be as high as 
      possible to get precise evaluations. <!-- *********** The Markus' idea ********** --><!-- *** titre *** -->

      <P>Mario Markus (from the Max Plank Institute for Nutrition) has imagined 
      dynamic systems just slightly more complex than the <A 
      href="http://perso.orange.fr/charles.vassallo/en/lyap_art/lyapdoc.html#f_log_2">logistic 
      formula</A>, where the fecundity is forced to alternate between two values 
      r1 and r2, following a periodic pattern. The period is described by a root 
      string made with "1" and "2"; for instance, a root "112" means that r 
      takes successive values r1,r1,r2, r1,r1,r2, r1,r1,r2....and so on. These 
      systems also display stable limit cycles or chaotic evolutions, depending 
      on r1 and r2. The stability or the chaos can be analysed by computing the 
      <A 
      href="http://perso.orange.fr/charles.vassallo/en/lyap_art/lyapdoc.html#exposant">Lyapunov 
      exponent</A>, through the above <A 
      href="http://perso.orange.fr/charles.vassallo/en/lyap_art/lyapdoc.html#recette">recipe</A>, 
      where the only change is that r is now forced to follow the prescribed 
      periodic pattern. 
      <P><IMG height=233 alt="[ image ]" hspace=8 
      src="Introduction to Markus-Lyapunov fractals_files/docpic2b.jpg" 
      width=308 align=left> The Markus pictures are simply a color mapping of 
      the Lyapunov exponent versus r1 and r2, along horizontal and vertical axes 
      respectively, for a given root string, here "1122". 
      <P>Only the stability domain is plotted; here, chaos (i.e. positive 
      exponents) is rendered in dark blue. When the exponent goes from 0 to 
      minus infinity, shades range from light to dark. At zero, (chaos 
      threshold), the color suddenly jumps from dark blue to a light shade. 
      Obviously, this color mapping is arbitrary and can be changed as you want. 
      <BR clear=all>
      <P>One thus gets strange shapes floating in a fantastic universe, with a 
      striking 3-D aspect. Of course, the pictures here are too small. You must 
      see them in a full screen to do them justice.
